# üì± iOS Projects Repository

This repository contains 5 iOS projects. Each project focuses on different aspects of iOS development, featuring a variety of technologies, patterns, and tools, including Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, Combine, MVVM pattern, and unit testing.

Each project folder is labeled with a corresponding task letter for easy identification.

## üöÄ Features
- 5 iOS Projects:
A collection of projects demonstrating various iOS development topics and practices.
Each folder represents a different task with unique features.
- Swift and UIKit:
Uses UIKit for building traditional user interfaces with Swift.
- SwiftUI:
Some projects also integrate SwiftUI for building modern, declarative user interfaces.
- Combine Framework:
Demonstrates Combine for handling reactive programming and managing asynchronous data streams.
- MVVM Pattern:
Projects following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns.
- Unit Testing:
Unit tests are written to ensure code reliability and correctness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Swift: The primary language for iOS development.
- UIKit: For building traditional user interfaces in iOS.
- SwiftUI: A declarative framework for building user interfaces in modern iOS applications.
- Combine: Reactive framework used to handle asynchronous events and data streams.
- MVVM: A design pattern used for better separation of concerns and scalable code.
- Unit Testing: Tests written using XCTest framework to validate the code and ensure robustness.
